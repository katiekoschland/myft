Aim:

 * To build a website that shows a list of news headlines from Financial Times. You may use the FT developer APIs to achieve this.
 * Provide a search box for users to search for headlines containing specific words (i.e. searching for "brexit" should return a list of brexit-related headlines)
 * Optionally, provide pagination for results, at 20 results per page.

 This website should be:

 * Server-rendered
 * Progressively enhanced
 * Responsive
 * Accessible

Bonus points, the site should:

  * Be built using javascript and Node.js
  * Be deployed on Heroku
  * Not rely too heavily on client-side frameworks (i.e. Angular, React) or libraries like jQuery
  * Have a similar look and feel as ft.com
  * Be performant over 3G networks

  It'd be really awesome if, on top of all of that, your site:

  * Uses Origami Components
  * Works offline
